# Using vupdated

`vupdated` is a daemon process that runs in the background and continually updates
the VU-1 dials to display system statistics, such as CPU load and temperature,
memory usage, swap space usage, et cetera.

On Linux systems, `vupdated` can also provide [USB hotplug
support](vupdated/hotplug.md) for VU-Server.
